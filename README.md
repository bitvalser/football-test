# FootballTest App

Test app for interview

### Task

Your task is to create a football information mobile app supporting the following requirements: 
The first screen will show a list of football teams. When a team is selected, it will show second screen with: 
- The teamâ€™s logo.
- Names of players in the team.
- A list of 10 (or fewer) upcoming matches for the team. You should show the name of the rival team, the date, and the competition (Champions League, Primera Division, etc.).

API call should implement in separate library (SDK)
For this exercise, you should implement the app in React Native/TypeScript so that it runs on iOS/Android platforms.
Football information is available from https://www.football-data.org/

#### Design / implementation guidelines 
- You can use whichever packages/components you want. 
- You do not have to write tests. 
- Pay attention to clean code. 

#### Submission 
Please either send a ZIP file containing the complete source files for the project, or a link to a github/bitbucket repo containing the code. Either way, I should be able to compile and run the project in a reasonable manner. 
Good luck!
